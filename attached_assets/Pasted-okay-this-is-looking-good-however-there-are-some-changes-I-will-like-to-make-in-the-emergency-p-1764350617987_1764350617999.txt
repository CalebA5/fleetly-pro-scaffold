okay this is looking good, however there are some changes I will like to make!

in the emergency page, I like the map view, however I will like the page that comes up after to be optimized, I like how once you click request emergency service like I asked. However when that page loads(with the blurry map in the background) I want the page that loads next to still have a similar map view, but tis time it will have the emergency details right below it, while showing the customers live location, and also the operators near him. (the emergency tracking page should be optimized). Also I want to fix the routing for the whole emergency page, such that it remebers the previous page it is coming from, meaning if the customer clicks emergency request from the request page, it should take them to the live emergecny tracking page. however if they want to return from that page, it takes them back to the previous page they are coming from. and its also easy to go back home.

Also the operator pins, I like how it has been modified to stay static, however when you zoom out or zoom in, the position of the operators shift and they move all over the map. I want the operator pins to remain in their exact location or postal code, regardless of if you mov thee screen, zoom in or out.

all the operators have an address in calgary , but when I zoom out, the pins move out of calgary.

also i do not see any changes made to the settings page, or either of the settings page from the drop down menu ( I know it is just one page shared by the both drop downs)

also i dont see any significant changes to the request service page like I asked. instead of having a seperate section for deescribe job descriotion, there should be a place to describe the job description when the user selects a service (depending on the type of service for eample some services might require dimensions, or pictures for services like hauling or courier), also I dont think all the services on the request service page show all the services the app offers. it only shows for 6 services. Optimize the whole service request page, and if you have already done so, i cannot see it. if so, optimize the new design to match these current description.

after selecting a service the user /customer should be able to describe more abouut the job )optional, and operatos will be able to request for pictures.

I also dont see the in app messaging system. for when customers request services and the service has been accepted or quoted. has this already been created, do I need to test it out by requesting a service fom an operator.

also lets clean up the data base to removle all the users that have been manualy created, by me or anyone else.

Also can you create 8 accounts to test with, just create the user log in and passwords, then I will go in and test all the functions from the customers point of view and the operators point of view.\

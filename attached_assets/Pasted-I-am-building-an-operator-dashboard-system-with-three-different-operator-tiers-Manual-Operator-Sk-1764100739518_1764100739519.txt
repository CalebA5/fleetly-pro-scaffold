I am building an operator dashboard system with three different operator tiers:

Manual Operator

Skilled & Equipped Operator

Professional Operator (Business/Fleet Manager)

All three tiers should share a similar dashboard structure, but each should unlock different features and UI elements.
Please follow the instructions below very carefully.

1. OVERALL APP LAYOUT STRUCTURE

All operator tiers must use one unified dashboard page layout, with content changing based on the operator tier.

The dashboard must include:

Top Metrics Slider (scrollable left/right)

Horizontal Tabs Section

Content Panel (dynamic based on selected tab)

Slide-out Navigation Drawer (left side menu)

Top Metrics Slider (always visible)

The system should allow showing/hiding metrics depending on operator tier.

Metrics may include:

Daily Earnings

Jobs Nearby

Active Jobs

Completed Today

Rating

Equipment Status

Drivers Active (professional only)

Fleet Count (professional only)

Radius Limit (manual only)

Make this modular so new metrics can be added in the future.

2. HORIZONTAL TABS (Below Metrics Slider)

All tiers should have tabs in this order:

Tabs:

Jobs

Equipment

Services

History

Profile

Important:

Only the Professional tier should have an additional “Manpower” tab.

Tabs should visually match modern driver apps (Uber Driver, Lyft Driver, Doordash Merchant app).

5. IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS
Build everything in a modular way, so:

components can be reused across tiers

features can be unlocked/locked by tier

future expansion is easy

UI Framework:

Use a clean modern style — minimalistic, card-based, mobile-first.

Important UX Requirements:

Dashboard must load extremely fast

Metrics slider must be scrollable and modular

Tabs must switch instantly

All lists must be paginated and lazy-loaded

All tier differences must be controlled with a single operator-tier variable

6. OPTIONAL — PLEASE CONFIRM

If needed, feel free to generate:

data models

API endpoints

reusable components

sample UI screens

navigation structure

authentication logic

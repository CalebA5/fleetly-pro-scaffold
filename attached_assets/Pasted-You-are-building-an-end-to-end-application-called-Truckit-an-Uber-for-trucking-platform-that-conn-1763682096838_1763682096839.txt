You are building an end-to-end application called Truckit, an “Uber-for-trucking” platform that connects customers to towing, hauling, debris removal, snow removal, and general trucking operators.

I already created the skeleton of the app, but now I need you to design and integrate ALL FEATURES BELOW and improve both UI and backend logic.

🚀 Truckit — Full App Specification
1. Core Concept

Truckit is an on-demand marketplace connecting:

Customers needing towing, hauling, junk removal, snow removal, roadside assistance, etc.

Operators with trucks, towing rigs, snow plows, flatbeds, or manual labor equipment.

The app must have two modes:

Customer Mode

Operator Mode

🆘 2. Emergency Mode (“SOS Feature”)

Create a dedicated emergency button on the homepage:

Emergency Help Now

No sign-in required (optional login later).

Auto-detect location.

Display 3 quick tiles:

Tow My Car

Roadside Assistance

Debris/Junk Blocking Driveway

Backend Logic:

Notify 5 nearest operators simultaneously.

First operator to accept gets the job.

Others are placed in a queue order.

If the first operator cancels → next operator is auto-notified.

Customer sees live status: “Finding nearby operator…” → “Operator accepted, arriving in X minutes.”

Include:

Real-time websocket updates

Push notifications

Distance-based priority

🏗 3. Guided Service Flow (Non-Emergency)

Build a smooth UX with tappable cards, not forms:

Select service type

Auto-location

Vehicle/load type selection

Optional photo upload

Instant pricing OR request operator quotes

Make this flow fully functional on both mobile + web.

🗺 4. Real-Time Map Interface

Build an interactive map UI showing:

Operators nearby

Estimated arrival times

Operator availability

Routes and navigation

🛠 5. Operator App Features

Operator dashboard must include:

Go Online / Offline toggle

Real-time list of job requests

Job acceptance with queueing logic

Job cancellation flow

Route navigation (Google Maps / Apple Maps deep link)

Earnings summary

Job history

Vehicle/equipment profile

Operator rating & verification status

📈 6. Ratings & Trust Layer

Implement:

Operator verification badges

Stars + written reviews

Average response time

Completion rate

Equipment list

📦 7. Business / Fleet Portal

Basic version:

Multi-job scheduling

Location-based management

Monthly billing

Repeat service templates

🧭 8. Safety Mode

Allow customers to share:

Live trip tracking

Operator info (name, license, vehicle)

Expected arrival time

🎙 9. Voice Booking Feature

Enable microphone input → convert to structured service request.

🛑 10. Dark Mode

Auto-switch based on system time.

🎨 11. UI/UX Deliverables (Required)

Generate AND integrate into the project:

A. Wireframes

Provide low-fidelity screen flows for:

Customer Home

Emergency Mode

Service Booking

Operator Dashboard

Operator Job Flow

Job Tracking Screen

B. User Flow Diagrams

Generate diagrams for:

Customer booking flow

Operator acceptance / queue flow

Emergency dispatch flow

Payment and job completion

C. High-Fidelity Mockups

Create modern, minimal mockups (using Tailwind, Figma-style code, or embedded SVG/CSS-based mockups).

The style should be:

Clean

Flat

Rounded corners (10–16px)

Light/dark mode compatible

Trucking/roadside-themed but modern

🗄 12. Database Requirements

Tables:

Users

Operators

Vehicles

Services

Jobs

EmergencyJobs

JobQueue

Ratings

Messages

Notifications

Billing & Payments

Trips

Use schemas that support:

Real-time updates

Location tracking (lat/lng)

Job queues

Operator availability

Prefer PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

🚦 13. Backend Requirements

Generate:

REST API endpoints

Authentication (email, phone, optional OTP)

Operator queueing logic

Emergency mode dispatch

Payment integration (Stripe)

Real-time WebSocket events

🌐 14. Frontend Requirements

Build in React + Tailwind OR Flutter for mobile.
Include:

Maps

Swipeable menus

Animation between screens

Push notifications

Persistent sessions

💳 15. Payment Logic

Support:

In-app card payments

Cash-on-arrival option

Payouts to operators

Escrow release after job completion

🧪 16. Deliverables From Replit (Important)

Please generate:
✔ Clean code structure
✔ Page components
✔ API handlers
✔ Database models
✔ Job queue logic
✔ Websocket listeners
✔ Wireframes (ASCII diagrams or rendered assets)
✔ High-fidelity UI mockups (svg/css or png output)
✔ User flow diagrams
✔ Explanations + integration instructions

🧩 17. Development Philosophy

Keep everything modular, scalable, and reusable.
Use clear separation of concerns:

/frontend

/backend

/operators

/customers

/shared

/ui

🚀 Execution

Please begin by:

Generating the file architecture.

Outputting the wireframes.

Creating the user flows.

Producing the UI components.

Implementing backend logic step-by-step.
